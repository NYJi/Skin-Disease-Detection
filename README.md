## 📌 Purpose
### ✔️ Improving a detection model Accuracy for skin disease data based on "Dermnet"
- The model can detect the skin conditions if it has similar of skin data
- Compare models that are based Deep Learning and Determine the best model what is fitted our project

### ✔️ Distributing an Apps of checking their skin condition
